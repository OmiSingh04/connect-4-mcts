WE ARE TOTALLY DITCHING THE 2048 GAME. THE STATE SPACE IS TOO LARGE.
SOMETHING MORE MANAGEABLE AND SOMEWHAT SIMPLER IS CONNECT FOUR.

I ALSO HAVE FOUND AN API WHICH RESPONDS WITH BEST SCORES FOR THE MOVES.

I CAN SIMPLY GET THE BEST MOVE FROM ARGMAX.

the goal right now is to simply build the game. entirely.
Which means build the MDP.




how does the API work??

there are two defined endpoints,

1) get moves - 
  get the suggested moves from thing.

  http://localhost:8009/index.php/getMoves?board_data=0000000000000000020000001200000210000021001012100&player=2


0 represents empty space.
1 represents player 1
2 represents player 2


how is the (6 x 7) board specified?

0000000
0000000
0002000
0001200
0002100
0002100
1012100

literally that, but write all those in that sequence in the same line
player=2







a fairly big change is that i cant use np.arrays as dict keys.
we can use tuples.
lets use tuples - format
take the state ((6, 7))
flatten it, and tuple
d[tuple(state.flatten())] = whatever
load and save policy
